Miniproject 2: Visualization of latent factors from movies

The matlab files *.m are for Problem 1. They are located in the
Problem 1 folder

plotsvd.py is for Problem 2, and applies the SVD and does the Visualization
Note that trymovies.txt is the same thing as movies.txt from the 
data set given to us.

Also note that moviesSVD.txt is the same thing as movies.txt from the Problem1
directory, which is not the same thing as movies.txt from the data set 
given to us.

The png files, located in the PNGs folder, are all for Problem 2b
